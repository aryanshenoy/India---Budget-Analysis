<h1>Budget-Allocation-and-Analysis-India</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This project helps the user to analyze the funds allocated by the government to different ministries, departments, and union territories for the financial year 2022-23, 20223-24, and 2024-25 (estimates only). While doing the project, the complete budget for the 2024-25 financial year wasn't released so estimates were considered for the analysis.
This analysis will help the public understand the changes in the funds allocated by the government and whether the funds have increased or decreased when compared to the last 2 financial years.
</p>
<h3>What the project uses?</h3>
<p>
This project has been built using Python libraries like TKinter, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
This project analyzes a CSV file that is taken from openbudgetindia.org. The CSV file consists of the amount of money that has been granted by the central government to different ministries and union territories for the 2022-23 financial year, 2023-24 financial year, and 2024-25 financial year (estimates).
</p>
<p>
Before analysis of the data in the CSV file, we use Pandas to clean and remove the unrequired data. Then we use TKinter to make an interactive User Interface. The user interface gives the user the choice of selecting the required ministry or union territory to see the funds allocated by the government from 2022-23 to 2024-25 (estimates) with the help of a graph. The graph has been created using the Python library called Matplotlib.
